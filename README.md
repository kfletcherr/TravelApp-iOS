## TravelApp-iOS

# Description

The TravelApp is a tool to assist individuals in organizing and keeping track of their vacations and memories. It allows users to create and manage “trips” for each vacation and includes a calendar which displays these trips. Each trip includes information on destinations, activities, steps to complete the trip planning, and when to complete it by. 

# Build and Run Steps

Via the Xcode IDE, ensure the selected scheme is TravelApp. Xcode displays the selected scheme in the toolbar of your project window. Select a destination where you run the built products (simulator or personal device). To select a destination, click the destination name, which is next to the scheme name in the toolbar. Select an appropriate device from the pop-up menu.

To build and run the app, choose Product > Run, or click the Run button in your project’s toolbar, or ⌘R (Command + R). After a successful build, Xcode will launch the app.
